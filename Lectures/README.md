## Additional Learning Resources

Below are selected external resources that I find useful for deepening understanding of statistical concepts and methods. These materials are **optional** and meant for students who want to explore topics in more detail or from a different perspective.

  - **How *Not* to Visualize Data**  
    For fun and to learn what to avoid, this Wikipedia article presents classic examples of misleading or confusing data visualizations and explains how poor design choices can distort information.
