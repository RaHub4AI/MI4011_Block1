Emissions from fossil fuel combustion, cement production, and land-use change continue to add large amounts of CO₂ to the atmosphere, altering the Earth’s energy balance and climate system.\n",

These sinks slow the rate of climate change by removing CO₂ from the atmosphere, even though they cannot fully compensate for human emissions.\n",
