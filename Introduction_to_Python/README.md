[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a *high-level, general-purpose programming language* used across many fields, including scientific research, data analysis, automation, web development, and machine learning. It is especially popular in science and data-driven disciplines because it is easy to read, flexible, and supported by a large ecosystem of libraries.

`Python` was started in 1989 by [**Guido van Rossum**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) (webpage: https://gvanrossum.github.io/) as a side project during the Christmas holidays while he was working at the Centrum Wiskunde and Informatica in the Netherlands. The first public release appeared in 1991.

> The name *Python* comes from the British comedy series [*Monty Python’s Flying Circus*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063929/), not from the snake.

Over time, `Python` grew from a general-purpose language into a major platform for scientific computing, data science, and artificial intelligence. This growth was driven largely by its rich ecosystem of third-party libraries. The *Python Package Index*, or [PyPI](https://pypi.org), hosts over 665,000 packages that extend `Python`’s functionality. `Python` consistently ranks among the most popular programming languages worldwide according to indices such as [TIOBE](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), [PYPL](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html), and [Stack Overflow surveys (2025)](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/technology).

Modern `Python` development is based on Python 3, first released in 2008. Python 2 reached its end of life in 2020 and is no longer supported. As of 2026, multiple Python 3 versions are actively maintained by the [*Python Software Foundation*](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/) under a regular release and long-term support policy.

`Python` is an *interpreted and dynamically typed language*, meaning code is executed line by line and variable types are handled automatically. Memory management is also automatic through *garbage collection*. `Python` supports several programming styles, including [*procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming*](https://medium.com/daresay/programming-paradigms-styles-581df31b31ad).

A core design goal of `Python` is *readability*. Code structure is defined by indentation rather than symbols, making programs easier to follow and reducing visual complexity.

> For example, consider a simple decision based on winter weather:

> ```python
> if snowing:
>     print("Wear boots!")
> else:
>     print("No snow today")
>     print("Regular shoes are fine")
> ```
>
> In `Python`, indentation alone defines the structure of the code. It is immediately clear which lines belong to each condition.
> In many other programming languages, the same logic requires explicit symbols to mark code blocks, for example, in `R`:
> 
> ```r
> if (snowing) {
>   print("Wear boots!")
> } else {
>   print("No snow today")
>   print("Regular shoes are fine")
> }
> ```

`Python` follows a standard coding style guide known as [*PEP 8*](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), where PEP stands for *Python Enhancement Proposal*. PEP 8 defines conventions for writing clear and consistent code, including rules for indentation, naming, spacing, and line length. In this course, you are expected to follow PEP 8 principles to promote readable and reproducible code.
