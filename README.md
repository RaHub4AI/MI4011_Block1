### About this block


This block introduces you to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical modeling using environmental datasets. You will learn how to examine data structure, visualize patterns, and apply statistical methods to support scientific interpretation and prediction.

The block emphasizes a data-first workflow. You will explore datasets before fitting models and learn how data characteristics, such as distributions, variability, and outliers, influence statistical choices. Examples and exercises are based on real problems from environmental chemistry, water quality, climate-related time series, and ecotoxicology.

All work in this block is carried out in Python using widely adopted scientific libraries. The focus is on clear, reproducible analysis similar to current research practice in environmental science.

### Aims of the block

The aim of this block is to equip you with the skills to analyze environmental data critically and responsibly. By the end of the block, you should be able to choose appropriate statistical tools, apply them correctly, and interpret results in a scientifically meaningful way.

Specifically, this block aims to help you:

- Understand the purpose of exploratory data analysis and how it guides modeling decisions  
- Summarize and visualize environmental data in a clear and informative way  
- Use basic statistical methods to investigate relationships and test hypotheses  
- Build and evaluate simple empirical statistical models  
- Develop reproducible and transparent data analysis workflows

   - Recognize limitations and potential sources of bias in data  

2. **Work with different types of environmental data**  
   - Identify numerical and categorical variables  
   - Select appropriate summaries and visualizations based on data type  

3. **Visualize and describe data distributions and relationships**  
   - Interpret plots commonly used in environmental science  
   - Use visualization to inform subsequent analysis steps  

4. **Perform statistical inference**  
   - Formulate null and alternative hypotheses  
   - Choose and apply appropriate statistical tests  
   - Interpret statistical significance in context  

5. **Analyze data using correlation and regression**  
   - Quantify relationships between variables  
   - Fit and interpret simple and multiple linear regression models
